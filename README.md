# latency_tester
For usage in testing the latencies associated with various web calls

This android application was custom developed for a client that had created a set of API endpoints and wanted to debug their runtimes 
while operating on a satellite internet connection while at sea. The application allows for you to specify a URL endpoint in the app 
settings, and then runs a series of webcalls logging their runtimes, and response values. These are then stored in CSV format and the 
provides a convenient way to email the results to yourself.
